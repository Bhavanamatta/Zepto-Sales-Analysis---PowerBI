🛒 Zepto Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
Overview

This project is a Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard built using Power BI, where I analyzed Zepto’s grocery data to understand revenue patterns, outlet performance, item categories, and customer ratings across multiple cities.

The goal was to uncover:

Which cities and outlet types drive the highest sales

How item categories and fat content influence purchase behaviour

What trends exist in average ratings, sales distribution, and outlet establishment

How outlet size and item visibility impact total revenue

⚙️ Tools & Skills Used

Power BI Desktop — data modeling, report design, and visualization

Power Query — data cleaning and transformations

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) — KPIs like Total Sales, Average Sales, and Rating Metrics

Data Storytelling — presenting insights clearly using clean UI and interactive visuals

🔍 Key Insights

Hyderabad and Chennai generated the highest sales among all cities.

Medium-sized outlets contributed significantly to total revenue, showing optimal performance balance.

Low-fat & regular-fat items had distinct sales patterns across outlets.

Item categories like Fruits, Snacks, Dairy, Bakery, and Beverages consistently led in sales volume.

Recent outlet establishments (years) showed strong growth trends indicating business expansion.
